description: 'This 1961 photograph was used to illustrate a news story about "sex
  desegregation" in science and the importance of encouraging more women to become
  scientists if the United States was to compete effectively in the Cold War. The
  accompanying caption reads: "Mrs. Carl Gibson who as Jane Blankenship won high science
  honors in school, combines her scientific work with advanced studies and homemaking."
  As a student at Oak Ridge High School, Blankenship won a number of honors. While
  completing a B.S. in chemistry at the University of Tennessee, she worked during
  the summers at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, where her father was a physical chemist.
  By 1961, she had married a chemical engineer, moved to California, and was working
  as a spectroscopist for Lockheed aircraft. (Image courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution.)'
